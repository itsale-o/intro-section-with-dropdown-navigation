## Overview

This is my solution to the intro section with dropdown navigation challenge. It was built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
